# **Code for CAVGN**



## Architecture:

1 data：
    We provide viewpoint projection images generated by CAVGN, which can be obtained from this link：[BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1K1xP0c_tjCGF0fe3RZkUQw?pwd=ydpj) 


2 dataloder：Load the corresponding dataset, generate path document and network input: point cloud model+worst quality view label

3 model：
    Corresponding model files are stored here.

4 trainer：
    Training and testing functions for viewpoint generation networks

5 ViewGenerate:
    GetXYZ.py is the file used to generate viewpoints, and we provide a pre-trained model on SJTU-PCQA for extracting tests.
    Specifically, after generating the viewpoint, a projection image needs to be generated using a projection method.

6 Application:
    You can choose various projection based methods and apply them by modifying the original input orthogonal projection image to the projection generated by CAVGN.
